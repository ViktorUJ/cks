### About CKA, CKS, CKAD scenarios
- use **aws**
- create **vpc** , **subnets**
- create  **ec2** (spot ) master and workers
- init master node by **kubeadm**
- copy join token to **s3**
- load   join token  from **s3** to **worker node** and join to the cluster .
- support versions:
````
k8s version  : [ 1.21 , 1.27 ]   https://kubernetes.io/releases/
Rintime :
    docker                   [1.21 , 1.23]

````

## Configuration
- change  **backend_bucket** ( **region** , **backend_region**  optional ) in [terragrunt.hcl](terraform%2Fenvironments%2Fterragrunt.hcl#L4) :
- create  [aws ec2 key-pair](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/create-key-pairs.html) with name=cks  in our region (default region = eu-north-1)


## Command
Every command should be run from the project's root directory.
