kubectl config use-context cluster1-admin@cluster1

```
k get po -n rsapp
```

NAME               READY   STATUS             RESTARTS   AGE
rs-app2223-78skl   0/1     ImagePullBackOff   0          7m55s

```
1. Edit replicaset executing the following command:
```
k edit rs -n rsapp rs-app2223
# Then change container image from rrredis:aline to redis:alpine
```
2. As it is replicaset we need to delete existing pods to allow ReplicaSet recreate them.
```
k  delete po -n rsapp -l app=rs-app2223
```
3. Ensure that new pods are running

```
k get po -n rsapp
```
