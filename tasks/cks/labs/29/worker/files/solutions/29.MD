1. Remove user `user` from docker group

```sh
usermod -rG docker user
```

2. Change docker socket permissions

```sh
# Check where is systemd configuration file is located and get path to the systemd unit file
systemctl status docker.socket
```

```text
docker.socket - Docker Socket for the API
     Loaded: loaded (/lib/systemd/system/docker.socket; enabled; vendor preset: enabled)
```

```sh
vim /lib/systemd/system/docker.socket
# and set from SocketGroup=docker to root

systemctl daemon-reload
systemctl restart docker.socket

# confirm that docker socket is being exposed under correct expressions
ls -la /var/run/docker.sock
```

3. Enhance docker security

```sh
# Check the path to the systemd docker unit file
systemctl status docker

# ‚óè docker.service - Docker Application Container Engine
#      Loaded: loaded (/lib/systemd/system/docker.service; enabled; vendor preset: enabled)

# Edit the file and remove -H tcp://0.0.0.0:2375 from ExecStart command
systemctl daemon-reload
systemctl restart docker
```
