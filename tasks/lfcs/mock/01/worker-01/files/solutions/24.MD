1. Run fdisk utility

```bash
# to create partitions run fdisk for disk /dev/nvme2n1
sudo fdisk /dev/nvme2n1
```

Put needed fields:

```sh
Changes will remain in memory only, until you decide to write them.
Be careful before using the write command.

Device does not contain a recognized partition table.
Created a new DOS disklabel with disk identifier 0x034ec39a.

Command (m for help): n <- PUT n here to create new partition
Partition type
   p   primary (0 primary, 0 extended, 4 free)
   e   extended (container for logical partitions)
Select (default p): p <- select p for primary partition
Partition number (1-4, default 1): <- Keep default 
First sector (2048-4194303, default 2048): <--Keep default
Last sector, +/-sectors or +/-size{K,M,G,T,P} (2048-4194303, default 4194303): +1G <-- Set 1G here

Created a new partition 1 of type 'Linux' and of size 1 GiB.

Command (m for help): n
Partition type
   p   primary (1 primary, 0 extended, 3 free)
   e   extended (container for logical partitions)
Select (default p): p <-- Set p

Using default response p.
Partition number (2-4, default 2):  <-- Keep default
First sector (2099200-6291455, default 2099200): <-- Keep default
Last sector, +/-sectors or +/-size{K,M,G,T,P} (2099200-6291455, default 6291455): +1G

Created a new partition 2 of type 'Linux' and of size 1 GiB.

Command (m for help): w  <-- write table to disk and exit
```

To check that the partitions were successfully created, run (put your attention to `nvme2n1p1` and `nvme2n1p2`):

```bash
$ lsblk /dev/nvme2n1
NAME        MAJ:MIN RM SIZE RO TYPE MOUNTPOINT
nvme2n1     259:1    0   3G  0 disk 
├─nvme2n1p1 259:6    0   1G  0 part 
└─nvme2n1p2 259:7    0   1G  0 part 
```

2. Mount the Partition

To mount the newly created partition:
```bash
sudo mkdir /drive

sudo bash -c "echo '/dev/nvme2n1p1 /drive ext4 defaults 0 0' >> /etc/fstab"
sudo mkfs.ext4 /dev/nvme2n1p1

sudo mount -a
```

To verify that the disk was properly mounted, run:

```bash
lsblk /dev/nvme2n1p1 --output FSTYPE,MOUNTPOINT
#or 
findmnt -n /dev/nvme2n1p1
```

3. Create XFS File System on the Second Partition

To create an XFS file system on the second partition:

```bash
sudo mkfs.xfs /dev/nvme2n1p2
```

To verify that the file system was properly created, run:

```bash
lsblk /dev/nvme2n1p2 --output FSTYPE
# you should see xfs here
```
